<p style="color:white">Check and monitor the person's airway, breathing, and pulse. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.</p>

<p style="color:white"> Try to make sure that the person has indeed been poisoned. It may be hard to tell. Some signs include chemical-smelling breath, burns around the mouth, difficulty breathing, vomiting, or unusual odors on the person. If possible, identify the poison.</p>

<p style="color:white">DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care professional</p>

<p style="color:white">If the person vomits, clear the person's airway. Wrap a cloth around your fingers before cleaning out the mouth and throat. If the person has been sick from a plant part, save the vomit. It may help experts identify what medicine can be used to help reverse the poisoning.</p>

<p style="color:white"> If the person starts having convulsions, give convulsion first aid.</p>

<p style="color:white">Keep the person comfortable. The person should be rolled onto the left side, and remain there while getting or waiting for medical help.</p>
<p style="color:white">If the poison has spilled on the person's clothes, remove the clothing and flush the skin with water.</p>
